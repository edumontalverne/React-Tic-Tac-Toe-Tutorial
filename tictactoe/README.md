# Tic Tac Toe

I builded this interactive tic-tac-toe game with React following the tutorial available at https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

OBS: I left the following coment in the code. Please, feel free to contact me and help me to understand.


    "According to the tutorial, the variable bellow is declared as "status",
    but when used within the <div> in the return of the component, the vscode
    points that 'status' is deprecated.

    The weird fact is that if I change the variable's name to "whatever name",
    the div is shown in the browser, even if the {status} is being called! 

    Can anyone explain it to me, please?"
